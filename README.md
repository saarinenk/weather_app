# Weather Application

This Weather Application allows the user to look up the current weather of any city or town. Just type the name of the city into the input-field and press "Submit". If you want to specify the country of the city, you can just type the country code after the city like presented below
```
London
London, GB
London, CA
```
The first two lines would both show the same weather, since London in UK is a bigger and more commonly known city than the one in Canada.
